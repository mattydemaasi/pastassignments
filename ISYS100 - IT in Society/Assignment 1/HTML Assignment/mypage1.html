<h2> Pugs - Canis lupus familiaris </h2>

<h5> Origin </h5>

<h4> Originally bred in China, over a thousand years ago, the Pug was brought to Europe by the Dutch East India Company.
  <br> In Europe they became the dog of aristocrats and royalty holding high status amongst dog breeds.
  <br>The pug became the official dog of the House of Orange, Holland, as recognition for saving the life of William, Prince of Orange, in 1572.
  <br>The Pug was also reportedly a favourite in France during Napoleonic times.
  <br>Napoleon's wife Josephine apparently had great affection for the breed and it is alleged her dog, Fortune, bit Napoleon as he climbed into bed on the couple's wedding night.
  <br>Pugs are one of the earliest pure breeds of dog kept in Australia.
  <br>Although it is uncertain as to when they arrived in this country, there are records from the Agricultural Society of NSW listing two pugs exhibited in 1870.</br> </br> </br> </br> </br> </br>
</h4>

<h5> Personality Traits </h5>
<h4> The Pug is keen, with a happy-go-lucky attitude. Animated, peppy and spirited, they are loyal, loving and affectionate with their families.
  <br> Playful, lively and rambunctious, they are sure to keep you laughing.
   <br>Pugs get along well with other dogs and pets, and they behave impeccably with both children and visitors.
    <br> It is relatively inactive indoors and will do okay without a yard.
     <br> Cannot withstand hot or cold weather and should be kept indoors at a comfortable temperature. </br></br> </br> </br>
